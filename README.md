# string-calculator
**1. Why parser class was created?**
Because I wanted to keep separated logic responsible for handling string and processing data from it.

**2. Why parser is private?**
Because I wanted to write a tests from StringCalculator class perspective. I didn't want to split test logic into two 
separate classes. (It was not asked about it in the exercise description)

**3. Why Interpreter was not used?**
I came to conclusions that parsing result was to simple for it.
